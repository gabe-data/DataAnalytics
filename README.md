This is a SQL project that analyzes the career of baseball legend Barry Bonds. My love for baseball, statistics, and analytics was what drove the idea behind this project. 

I first downloaded three separate tables from baseballreference.com One was Bonds' career stats, his advanced stats, and finally his sabometrics stats. These were exported to Excel where I fixed little things like the column titles and formatting of the decimals. 

Once this was done, I imported the files into a schema I had set up in Dbeaver using a PostgreSQL database. Here I was able to analyze the data using all sorts of queries such as window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), CASE statements, subqueries, JOINS, and much more. 

Each query has a question or request in the form of a comment that can help the reader understand what exactly is trying to be achieved. 

A table that shows his career home run totat year by year, another showing his total home runs for the first and second half of his career, and one query indicating whether or not he had a better than league average batting average are some examples of the questions answered.
